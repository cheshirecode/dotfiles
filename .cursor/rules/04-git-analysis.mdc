# Git Analysis Guidelines

## Repository Analysis
- Always examine commit history to understand project evolution
- Check branch structure and merge patterns
- Analyze file change patterns to understand codebase architecture
- Review recent commits for context on current development state

## Git Best Practices
- Use conventional commit messages
- Create focused, atomic commits
- Maintain clean branch history
- Use meaningful branch names that describe the feature/fix

## Code Investigation
- Use git blame to understand code authorship and timing
- Check git log for files to understand their evolution
- Examine diffs to understand changes between versions
- Use git tools to track down bug introductions
